# Overview ‚ú®
This is a passion project for my online portfolio, starting from complete scratch I will learn Tailwind and refine my Typescript while using Next.js, JavaScript and HTML. The purpose of this website is to hopefully give an insight into who I am and have an area where I can tinker and play with code!

# Planning stage üìù
I've got a general idea in mind featuring a small compact box styled components which can be clicked on to further expand on the component (for exmaple my work experience will feature the title, start and end date but clicking on it will open another component which will further expand on what I did during that job, relevant job experience, responsabilities etc.)

## Disney Ideation üè∞
Starting off I've decided to use disney ideation to create a general outline of MVPs with the dreamer section being more of a stretch objective once the basics of the website has been made, this was made using Canva.

## Wireframing ‚úèÔ∏è
Using disney ideation sections as general MVPs I decided to start developing a general design file which is subject to a lot of change, focusing on small laptops first then standard desktop and finally mobile as the lowest priority (my reasioning being that most of those who are viewing my portfolio will be viewing from a laptop or desktop)

***ALL DESIGNS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE***

### Small laptop üíª
I used Figma to help me create my prototype, starting off with small laptop resolution (Macbook air 1):

Being a static image I can't completely show the entire scope of my webpage with dynamic elements. Hover should display a white border to let the user know the limits of the div, hovering the menu will also slightly enlarge it to let user know its interactable. The black borders help signify clickable components which should expand and help the user see more information about the specific parts they've clicked on. 



### Standard desktop üñ•Ô∏è
Following that I've decided to tackle the standard desktop new which was fairly simple as they use extremely similar layout:

### Mobile üì±
Finally the mobile wireframe which is subject to the most amount of changes.

## Which? ‚ùì
With the general designs planned, the next step for me was to choose which coding langauge, frameworks and libraries to use. 

### Coding languages
**Tailwind** - Having never done any Tailwind I thought it was a good oppurtinity
