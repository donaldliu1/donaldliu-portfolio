# Overview
This is a passion project for my online portfolio, starting from complete scratch I will learn Tailwind and refine my Typescript while using Next.js, JavaScript and HTML. The purpose of this website is to hopefully give an insight into who I am and have an area where I can tinker and play with code!

# Planning stage
I've got a general idea in mind featuring a small compact box styled components which can be clicked on to further expand on the component (for exmaple my work experience will feature the title, start and end date but clicking on it will open another component which will further expand on what I did during that job, relevant job experience, responsabilities etc.)

### Disney Ideation
Starting off I've decided to use disney ideation to create a general outline of MVPs with the dreamer section being more of a stretch objective once the basics of the website has been made.
